## Conclusion
- Completed a full vulnerability scan on the local PC.  
- Identified critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities.  
- Documented mitigation steps for critical issues.  
- Gained introductory experience in vulnerability assessment and risk prioritization.

---

## Notes
- **Frequency of scans:** Monthly or after major updates.  
- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)** used for severity assessment.  
- **False Positives:** Some reported vulnerabilities may not be applicable; verify before remediation.
